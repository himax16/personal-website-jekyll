<h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>

<p>I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a
    href="https://plasma.princeton.edu">Princeton Program of Plasma
    Physics</a>. I am currently working for <a
    href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~kunz/Site/Welcome.html">Prof. Matthew
    W.
    Kunz</a> in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My main research interest is the
  <strong>high-performance simulation</strong> of
  fundamental plasma processes, mainly in astrophysical systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I grew up in <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malang">Malang, Indonesia</a> before
  obtaining my Bachelor of Arts (<em>A.B.</em>) for Physics from Princeton
  University in 2018. Outside of my research, I
  have various interests which can be seen from my <a
    href="/activities/">activities</a> and <a href="/blog/">personal
    blog posts</a>.
