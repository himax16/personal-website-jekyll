**Josee, the Tiger and the Fish 「ジョゼと虎と魚たち」** is a short story written by **Seiko Tanabe**. A part of the eponymous short story anthology first published in 1985. The story has been adapted into two live action movies in Japan (2003) and in [Korea (2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9e_(film)) as well as [an animated movie (2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josee,_the_Tiger_and_the_Fish_(2020_film)).

My first exposure to the story came from watching the animated movie. Written as a light-hearted romance drama, there are several aspects of the stories that worth to be explored. Given that I was not able to watch the first Japanese live action movie, this review will only compare the animated movie storyline to the original short story and the Korean live action movie.

# TL;DR
_**What will you do when faced with obstacles beyond your control?**_

The story revolves around the wheelchair-user protagonist, who called herself Josee, and his caretaker who got entangled with her due to an accident. The story explores the theme of facing the challenges (tiger) and navigating your dream (fish). This includes further discussions about dealing with status quo and the meaning of sacrifice. The animated movie has an underlying comedic yet reflective tone to deliver the message. Combined with excellent music scores and vibrant art style, I really enjoy watching the movie. Both the original short story and Korean live action movie have different interpretations to answer the three main points of the story and worth to be discussed as comparison.

Beyond this point, the review will contain **heavy spoiler** from the animated movie, original short story, and the Korean movie.

# Animated Movie
The movie starts by introducing Tsuneo, our male protagonist,

Our paraplegic female protagonist Kumiko, who prefers to be called Josee, have to use the wheelchair to get around. She lives with her grandmother (Chizu Yamamura) who takes her out in the night, hoping that it will be safer as they would not be seen by the others. One day, Kumiko's wheel chair rolled down the hill uncontrollably. Luckily our male protagonist Tsuneo happened to pass by and caught her.

After that, Tsuneo accepted the offer to be Josee's _caretaker_ for saving more money. Before meeting Josee, Tsuneo had been living frugally while working in a dive shop with Yamato and Mai, his two coworkers. Tsuneo did all of this in order to fund his dream studying abroad in Mexico and diving along with a school of [clarion angelfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_angelfish).

> _"The outside (world) is full of scary beast"「外は恐ろしい猛獣ばかり」_

It is the phrase that Chizu always repeats to Josee to justify her inaction, keeping Josee isolated from the outside world. This bring us to the first point of the story, **dealing with _status quo_**. Being trapped in the house with her reluctant grandmother, Josee had to give up her dreams of seeing the outside world. She indulged herself in painting and reading, especially the work of Françoise Sagan, from where she got the name Josee. Only after Tsuneo came along, Josee tried to face her beast
